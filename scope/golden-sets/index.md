# Golden Sets

:::info Coming Soon
Detailed documentation for golden sets is coming soon. In the meantime, see
[Testing Prompts](../prompt-management/testing-prompts.md) for an overview of
golden set capabilities.
:::

Golden sets are curated collections of input/output pairs used for systematic
prompt testing. They allow you to:

- Define expected inputs and outputs for a prompt
- Run regression tests when prompt content changes
- Track test results over time
- Source test items from manual entry, query history, or previous test runs
