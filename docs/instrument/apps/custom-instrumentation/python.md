# Python

Implement OpenTelemetry custom instrumentation for `Python` applications to
collect logs, metrics, and traces using the Python OTel SDK.

> **Note:** This guide provides a concise overview based on the official
> OpenTelemetry documentation. For complete information, please consult the
> [official OpenTelemetry documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/).

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to:

- Set up OpenTelemetry custom instrumentation for `Python`
- Configure manual tracing using spans
- Create and manage custom metrics
- Add semantic attributes and events
- Export telemetry data to Scout Collector

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Python 3.7 or later installed
- A Python project set up
- Access to package installation (`pip`)

## Required Packages

Install the following necessary packages or add them to `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install opentelemetry-api
pip install opentelemetry-sdk
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp

# Optional but recommended
pip install opentelemetry-semantic-conventions
```

## Traces

Traces give us the big picture of what happens when a request is made to an
application. Whether your application is a monolith with a single database or a
sophisticated mesh of services, traces are essential to understanding the full
“path” a request takes in your application.

### Initialization

To Start tracing, first a tracer should be acquired and a TraceProvider should
be initialized optionally we can pass a resource to TraceProvider.

> A Resource is an immutable representation of the entity producing telemetry.
> For example, a process producing telemetry that is running in a container on
> Kubernetes has a Pod name, it is in a namespace and possibly is part of a
> Deployment which also has a name. All three of these attributes can be
> included in the Resource.

Sample Reference code for Initialization

```python showLineNumbers
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource, SERVICE_NAME
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import (
    BatchSpanProcessor,
    ConsoleSpanExporter,
)
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

resource = Resource({SERVICE_NAME: "my.service.name"})
provider = TracerProvider(resource=resource)
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter(endpoint="http://0.0.0.0:4318/v1/traces"))
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(processor)

# Sets the global default tracer provider
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)

# Creates a tracer from the global tracer provider
tracer = trace.get_tracer("my.tracer.name")
```

> View your traces in the base14 Scout observability platform.
>
> **Note**: Ensure your Scout Collector is properly configured to receive and
> process the trace data.

### Span

A span represents a unit of work or operation. Spans are the building blocks of
Traces. In OpenTelemetry, they include some necessary information.

#### Creating a Span

```python showLineNumbers
def do_work():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("span.name") as span:
        # do some work that 'span' tracks
        print("doing some work...")
```

#### Creating nested Spans

```python showLineNumbers
def do_work():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("parent") as parent:
        # do some work that 'parent' tracks
        print("doing some work...")
        # Create a nested span to track nested work
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("child") as child:
            # do some work that 'child' tracks
            print("doing some nested work...")
```

#### Creating Spans with decorators

```python showLineNumbers
@tracer.start_as_current_span("span")
def do_work():
    print("doing some work...")
```

> View these spans in base14 Scout observability backend.

[Official Span Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#spans)

### Attributes

Attributes let you attach key/value pairs to a span so it carries more
information about the current operation that it’s tracking.

#### Adding Attributes to a Span

```python showLineNumbers
def do_work():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("span.name") as span:
        span.set_attribute("operation.value", 1)
        span.set_attribute("operation.name", "Saying hello!")
        span.set_attribute("operation.other-stuff", [1, 2, 3])

        print("doing some work...")
```

#### Adding Semantic Attributes to a Span

Semantic Attributes are pre-defined Attributes that are well-known naming
conventions for common kinds of data. Using Semantic Attributes lets you
normalize this kind of information across your systems.

> Ensure that you have installed `opentelemetry-semantic-conventions` package
> for using Semantic Attributes

```python showLineNumbers
from opentelemetry.semconv.trace import SpanAttributes

def do_work():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("span.name") as span:
        span.set_attribute(SpanAttributes.HTTP_METHOD, "GET")
        span.set_attribute(SpanAttributes.HTTP_URL, "https://base14.io/")

        print("doing some work...")
```

> View these spans in the base14 Scout observability platform.
>
> **Note**: Ensure your Scout Collector is properly configured to receive and
> process the span data.

#### Reference

[Official Attributes Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#attributes)

### Events

An event is a human-readable message on a span that represents “something
happening” during its lifetime.

You can think of it as a primitive log.

#### Adding an event to a span

```python showLineNumbers
def do_work():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("span.name") as span:
        span.add_event("Starting some work")
        print("doing some work...")
        span.add_event("Finished working")
```

#### Reference

[Official Event Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#span-events)

### Span Status

A Status can be set on a Span, typically used to specify that a Span has not
completed successfully - `Error`. By default, all spans are Unset, which means a
span completed without error. The `Ok` status is reserved for when you need to
explicitly mark a span as successful rather than stick with the default of
`Unset` (i.e., “without error”).

We also look at how to record an exception in the Span.

#### Setting a Span Status

```python showLineNumbers
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.trace import Status, StatusCode

def do_work():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("span.name") as span:
        try:
            # something that might fail
        except Exception as exception:
            span.set_status(Status(StatusCode.ERROR))
            span.record_exception(exception)
```

> View these spans in the base14 Scout observability platform.
>
> **Note**: Ensure your Scout Collector is properly configured to receive and
> process the span data.

## Metrics

### Initialization

To start collecting metrics, you’ll need to initialize a MeterProvider and
optionally set it as the global default.

Sample Reference code for Metrics Initialization

```python showLineNumbers
from opentelemetry import metrics
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics import MeterProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.metrics.export import (
    ConsoleMetricExporter,
    PeriodicExportingMetricReader,
)
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.grpc.metric_exporter import OTLPMetricExporter

metric_reader = PeriodicExportingMetricReader(OTLPMetricExporter(endpoint="http://0.0.0.0:4317/v1/metrics"))
metric_provider = MeterProvider(metric_readers=[metric_reader])
metrics.set_meter_provider(metric_provider)

# Creates a meter from the global meter provider
meter = metrics.get_meter("my.meter.name")
```

> View these metrics in base14 Scout observability backend.
>
> **Note**: Ensure your Scout Collector is properly configured to receive and
> process the trace data.

### Counter

Counter is a synchronous Instrument which supports non-negative increments.

#### Creating a Synchronous Counter

```python showLineNumbers
work_counter = meter.create_counter(
    "work.counter", unit="1", description="Counts the amount of work done"
)

def do_work(work_type: string):
    work_counter.add(1, {"work.type": work_type})
    print("doing some work...")
```

> View these metrics in base14 Scout observability backend.

#### Creating Asynchronous Counter

```python showLineNumbers
from opentelemetry.metrics import Observation

def pf_callback(callback_options):
    return [
        Observation(8, attributes={"pid": 0, "bitness": 64}),
        Observation(37741921, attributes={"pid": 4, "bitness": 64}),
        Observation(10465, attributes={"pid": 880, "bitness": 32}),
    ]


meter.create_observable_counter(name="PF", description="process page faults", callbacks=[pf_callback])
```

[Official Counter Documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/api/#counter)

### Histogram

Histogram is a synchronous Instrument which can be used to report arbitrary
values that are likely to be statistically meaningful. It is intended for
statistics such as histograms, summaries, and percentile.

#### Creating a Histogram

```python showLineNumbers
http_server_duration = meter.create_histogram(
    name="http.server.duration",
    description="measures the duration of the inbound HTTP request",
    unit="ms",
    value_type=float)

http_server_duration.Record(50, {"http.request.method": "POST", "url.scheme": "https"})
http_server_duration.Record(100, http_method="GET", http_scheme="http")
```

## Extracting Trace and Span IDs

To extract trace ID and span ID from the current context for log correlation or
debugging purposes:

```python showLineNumbers
from opentelemetry import trace

def get_trace_span_ids():
    # Get the current span
    current_span = trace.get_current_span()

    if current_span.is_recording():
        # Extract trace ID and span ID
        span_context = current_span.get_span_context()
        trace_id = format(span_context.trace_id, '032x')
        span_id = format(span_context.span_id, '016x')

        print(f"Trace ID: {trace_id}")
        print(f"Span ID: {span_id}")

        return trace_id, span_id
    else:
        print("No active span found")
        return None, None

# Usage within a traced function
def traced_function():
    with tracer.start_as_current_span("my-operation") as span:
        trace_id, span_id = get_trace_span_ids()
        # Use these IDs for log correlation or debugging
        print(f"Processing operation with trace: {trace_id}, span: {span_id}")
```
