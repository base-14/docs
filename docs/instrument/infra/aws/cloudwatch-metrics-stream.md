Using Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams and Amazon Data Firehose, you can get
CloudWatch metrics into Scout Backend with only a two to three minute latency.
This is significantly faster than polling approach

## Step 1: Creating a S3 Bucket

First, We'll create a s3 to bucket to store the metrics

### 1. Go to [S3 Dashboard](https://ap-south-1.console.aws.amazon.com/s3)

![S3 Search in Console](/img/cloudwatch-kinesis-stream/search-s3-aws-console.png)

### 2. Click on `Create bucket` button

![S3 Dashboard ScreenShot](/img/cloudwatch-kinesis-stream/s3-dashboard.png)

### 3. Enter the bucket name as `cloudwatch-metrics-stream-bucket`

> leave all the other settings to default options.

### 4. Scroll down and click on `Create bucket`

## Step 2: Creating a Kinesis Firehose stream

Now, we'll create a kinesis stream which cloudwatch can use to stream metrics

### 1. Go to [Kinsis Firehose Dashboard](https://ap-northeast-3.console.aws.amazon.com/firehose/home)

![Amazon Kinesis Firehose Search in Console](/img/cloudwatch-kinesis-stream/search-kinesis-firehose.png)

### 2. Click on `Create Firehose Stream` button

![AWS Kinesis Firehose Dashboard](/img/cloudwatch-kinesis-stream/kinesis-firehose-dashboard.png)

### 3. Set up the Sources

- Select `Direct PUT` as the input source and `S3` as the output.
- Select the S3 bucket name we created.

> Format is `s3://<your-bucket-name>`

- Enable `New Line Delimiter` and leave everything else as default settings.
- Scroll down and click on `Create Firehose Stream`.

## Step 3: Creating a Metrics Stream pipeline

Now, we'll configure cloudwatch to use the kinesis firehose stream to stream
metrics to S3

### 1. Navigate to Cloudwatch dashboard and

### Select streams under Metrics

![cloudwatch dashboard](/img/cloudwatch-kinesis-stream/cloudwatch-dashboard.png)

### 2. Click on `Create Metrics Stream`

### 3. Configuring the Stream

- Select `Custom Setup with Firehose`.
- Change output format to `opentelemetry 1.0`
- Select the required metrics.
- Give a name to the pipeline. `Click on`Create Metrics Stream`.

> Good Job, Now the Cloudwatch metrics are streaming to a S3 bucket.

## Step 4: Creating a lambda function

Now, let's create a lambda function to read from the s3 and send it to Scout
Collector

### 1. Create a layer with all the necessary packages

```shell
mkdir python
# move into that directory
cd python

# install requests module
pip install --target . requests opentelemetry-proto protobuf
# zip the contents under the name dependencies.zip
zip -r dependencies.zip ../python
```

### 2. Navigate to AWS Lambda dashboard and click on `Layers`

![lambda dashboard](/img/cloudwatch-kinesis-stream/lambda-dashboard.png)

- Click on `Create layer` button

### 3. Fill the necessary detials and update the zip file

![create lambda page](/img/cloudwatch-kinesis-stream/create-lambda-layer-page.png)

### 4. Naviagte to functions page and Click on `Create function` button

![lambda functions page](/img/cloudwatch-kinesis-stream/lambda-functions-page.png)

- Select `Author from scratch`.
- Give a funciton name.
- Choose `python x.x` as the runtime.
- Select `x86_64` as the Architecture.

- Once the function is created, follow the below steps to configure it,

- Click on the `Configuration` tab and then click on `permissions`.
- Click on the Role name and give S3 Full access for the above created bucket.
- Click on `Code` and scroll to add a new layer.
- Click on `Add Layer`.
- Select `Custom Layer` and choose the layer that we created.
- Navigate back to the code and click on `Add trigger`.
- Select `S3` as the source and select the bucket from dropdown.
- Click on `Add`.
- Navigate to `Configuration` and then to `Environment variables`.
- Click on `edit` and these two environment variables with correct values.
  (`OTEL_COLLECTOR_URL`, `S3_BUCKET_NAME`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`).

Now the actual part, copy the below code into the `code source` in your lambda
function.

```python
import boto3
import requests
import os
from opentelemetry.proto.collector.metrics.v1.metrics_service_pb2 import ExportMetricsServiceRequest
from google.protobuf.internal.decoder import _DecodeVarint32


s3 = boto3.client('s3')
client_id=os.environ.get('CLIENT_ID')
client_secret=os.environ.get('CLIENT_SECRET')
token_url=os.environ.get('TOKEN_URL')
endpoint_url=os.environ.get('ENDPOINT_URL')

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    for record in event['Records']:
        bucket_name = record['s3']['bucket']['name']
        file_key = record['s3']['object']['key']
        print(f"Processing file: {file_key}")
        file_obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=file_key)
        buffer = file_obj['Body'].read()
        pos = 0
        buffer_len = len(buffer)

        request_count = 0
        success_count = 0
        headers = {}

        # Ensure the content-type is set
        headers["Content-Type"] = "application/x-protobuf"
        # Process all messages in the buffer
        while pos < buffer_len:
            # Decode the varint (message length)
            msg_len, new_pos = _DecodeVarint32(buffer, pos)
            pos = new_pos

            # Extract the message bytes
            msg_buf = buffer[pos : pos + msg_len]
            # Parse the message to validate it (optional)
            request = ExportMetricsServiceRequest()
            request.ParseFromString(msg_buf)

            for resource_metric in request.resource_metrics:
                if resource_metric.resource:
                    resource_metric.resource.attributes.add(
                        key="service.name",
                        value={"string_value": "aws-cloudwatch-stream18may"}
                    )
                    resource_metric.resource.attributes.add(
                        key="service.uname",
                        value={"string_value": "aws-cloudwatch-stream18may"}
                    )

            # Send the raw serialized message


            token_response = requests.post(
                token_url,
                data={
                    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
                    "audience": "b14collector",  # Optional, based on your provider
                },
                auth=(client_id, client_secret),
                verify=False,  # Optional: set to False to skip TLS cert verification (NOT RECOMMENDED for prod)
            )
            token_response.raise_for_status()
            access_token = token_response.json()["access_token"]
            headers["Authorization"] = f"Bearer {access_token}"

            response = requests.post(
                endpoint_url,
                data=request.SerializeToString(),
                headers=headers,
                verify=False,
            )
            if resource.status_code == 200:
                print("Metrics successfully forwarded.")
            else:
                print(
                    f"Failed to send metrics. Status: {response.status_code}, "
                    f"Response: {response.text}"
                )
            pos += msg_len
```

- Click on the `Deploy`

## That's it, you're done

Head back to the Scout dashboards to view all your AWS Services metrics.
